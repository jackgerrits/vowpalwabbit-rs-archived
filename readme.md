[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackgerrits/vowpalwabbit-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackgerrits/vowpalwabbit-rs)

This repo wraps the [native bindings crate](https://github.com/jackgerrits/vowpalwabbit-sys-rs) and provides better Rust interfaces for interacting with the system. (Work in progress)

It also serves as a staging ground for experimenting with Rust in the context of VW.
